This is Greendale, Annie. If there's a conspiracy, it goes all the way to *slightly* below the middle.
No no, its fine, it's fine. It's just little a nose bleed. I get 'em when it's dry and when my face gets kicked.
To me, religion is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it.
I'm no sociopath. I always know what I'm doing is wrong.
I'm sorry, Annie. I'm not the worker bee type. I'm more of a silverback gorilla with the claws of a lion, the teeth of a shark, and quiet dignity of a tortoise.
I teach law at Greendale, so believe me, I don't know much about law.
